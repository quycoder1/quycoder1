# Hi, I’m Trần Đức Quý — aka "Quý IT"!

Hey there! I’m a Gen Z coder from Vietnam who’s into OS hopping, low-end machines, and doing cool stuff with Python and C++. I love exploring the internals of systems and building things from scratch — even on a 4GB RAM Celeron laptop.

## About Me

- 🧠 Passionate about Linux — especially **Arch Linux** (yeah, I use Arch btw)
- ⚙️ Tweak configs, break systems, fix them, and call it "learning"
- 💻 Mainly work with **Python** and **C++** — also doing some Arduino stuff
- 🧪 Currently playing around with ideas like writing **Tailwind-style CSS with Python**
- 🌀 Still switching between **Windows 11** and **Pop!\_OS**, because… curiosity!

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Bash  
- **OSes I love:** Arch Linux, Pop!_OS, Windows 11  
- **Tools:** VS Code, nano (yes, nano), Arduino IDE  
- **Web Dev:** Flask, FastAPI, and experimenting with TailwindCSS in Python

## Current Goals

- Build a tool that generates Tailwind classes using Python  
- Create a fast, clean, and minimal Linux desktop setup that works even on potato PCs  
- Learn advanced C++ and use it to level up my projects

## A little more about me

- I watch Backrooms lore for fun  
- I reinstall OSes when I’m bored  
- I don’t back up my system — I fix things by breaking them first
