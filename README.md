Hey there! I’m a Gen Z coder from Vietnam who’s into OS hopping, low-end machines, and doing cool stuff with Python and C++. I love exploring the internals of systems and building things from scratch — even on a 4GB RAM Celeron laptop.

## About Me

- 🧠 Passionate about Linux — especially **Arch Linux** (yeah, I use Arch btw)
- ⚙️ Tweak configs, break systems, fix them, and call it "learning"
- 💻 Mainly work with **Python** and **C++**
- 🧪 Currently playing around with ideas like writing **Tailwind-style CSS with Python**
- 🌀 Still switching between **Windows 11** and **Pop!\_OS**, because… curiosity!

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Bash  and JS/JSX (React.js)
- **OSes I love:** Arch Linux, Pop!_OS, Windows 11  
- **Tools:** VS Code, neovim (yes, neovim)
- **Web Dev:** Flask, FastAPI, and React

## Current Goals

- Learn React and React Native for improving my skills
- Learn advanced C++ and use it to level up my projects

## A little more about me

- I watch Backrooms lore for fun  
- I reinstall OSes when I’m bored  
- I don’t back up my system — I fix things by breaking them first

> "If it breaks, I learn. If it doesn’t, I tweak it until it does."
